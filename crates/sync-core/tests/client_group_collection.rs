// Abandoned client groups are collected when the retained-ledger floor passes
// them.
//
// Nothing could collect a group before `_zsync_client_group_seen` existed:
// `delete_clients` only runs when a live client TELLS the server which of its
// clients it deleted, so a client that simply never returns leaves its whole
// membership behind forever. A real store reached 607 groups and 640k
// membership rows while serving three clients.
//
// The rule under test is not a timeout. A group last served below the floor can
// no longer be sent a diff — its next pull is a full snapshot regardless — so
// its cached membership has already lost the only thing it is for.
