# orez

It's [Zero](https://zero.rocicorp.dev) and [Postgres](https://pglite.dev) with no native dependencies in one package. Helped by a custom WASM fork of SQLite's [bedrock branch](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?t=begin-concurrent) called [bedrock-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bedrock-sqlite). No Docker, no Postgres install, no `node-gyp`, no platform-specific binaries.

```
bunx orez
```

Starts PGlite (WASM Postgres), a TCP proxy, and zero-cache with WASM SQLite. Exports a CLI, programmatic API, and Vite plugin. Comes with PGlite extensions `pgvector` and `pg_trgm` enabled by default.

Ports auto-increment if already in use.

## Programmatic

```typescript
import { startZeroLite } from 'orez'

const { config, stop, db, instances } = await startZeroLite({
  pgPort: 6434,
  zeroPort: 5849,
  migrationsDir: 'src/database/migrations',
  seedFile: 'src/database/seed.sql',
})

// your app connects to zero-cache at localhost:5849
// database is at postgresql://user:password@localhost:6434/postgres

// db is the postgres PGlite instance (for direct queries)
// instances has all three: { postgres, cvr, cdb }

// when done
await stop()
```

All options are optional with sensible defaults. Ports auto-find if in use.

## Vite plugin

```typescript
import orez from 'orez/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    orez({
      pgPort: 6434,
      zeroPort: 5849,
      migrationsDir: 'src/database/migrations',
    }),
  ],
}
```

Starts orez when vite dev server starts, stops on close.

## How it works

orez starts three things:

1. Three PGlite instances (full PostgreSQL 16 running in-process via WASM) — one for each database zero-cache expects (upstream, CVR, change)
2. A TCP proxy that speaks the PostgreSQL wire protocol, routing connections to the correct PGlite instance and handling logical replication
3. A zero-cache child process that connects to the proxy thinking it's a real Postgres server

### Multi-instance architecture

zero-cache expects three separate databases: `postgres` (app data), `zero_cvr` (client view records), and `zero_cdb` (change-streamer state). In real PostgreSQL these are independent databases with separate connection pools and transaction contexts.

orez creates a separate PGlite instance for each database, each with its own data directory and mutex. This is critical because PGlite is single-session — all proxy connections to the same instance share one session. Without isolation, transactions on the CVR database get corrupted by queries on the postgres database (zero-cache's view-syncer detects this as `ConcurrentModificationException` and crashes). Separate instances eliminate cross-database interference entirely.

The proxy routes connections based on the database name in the startup message:

| Connection database | PGlite instance | Data directory    |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| `postgres`          | postgres        | `pgdata-postgres` |
| `zero_cvr`          | cvr             | `pgdata-cvr`      |
| `zero_cdb`          | cdb             | `pgdata-cdb`      |

Each instance has its own mutex for serializing queries. Extensions (pgvector, pg_trgm) and app migrations only run on the postgres instance.

### Replication

zero-cache needs logical replication to stay in sync with the upstream database. PGlite doesn't support logical replication natively, so orez fakes it. Every mutation is captured by triggers into a changes table, then encoded into the pgoutput binary protocol and streamed to zero-cache through the replication connection. zero-cache can't tell the difference.

The replication handler also tracks shard schema tables (e.g., `chat_0.clients`, `chat_0.mutations`) that zero-cache creates for mutation state. These are monitored via change tracking triggers so that `.server` promises on zero mutations resolve correctly.

### Zero native dependencies

The whole point of orez is that `bunx orez` works everywhere with no native compilation step. Postgres runs in-process as WASM via PGlite. But zero-cache also needs SQLite, and `@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3` ships as a compiled C addon — which means `node-gyp`, build tools, and platform-specific binaries.

orez ships its own package, [bedrock-sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bedrock-sqlite) — SQLite's [bedrock branch](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?t=begin-concurrent) recompiled to WASM with BEGIN CONCURRENT and WAL2 support. At startup, orez patches `@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3` to load bedrock-sqlite instead of the native C addon. Both databases run as WASM — nothing to compile, nothing platform-specific. Just `bun install` and go.

## Environment variables

Your entire environment is forwarded to the zero-cache child process. This means any `ZERO_*` env vars you set are passed through automatically.

orez provides sensible defaults for a few variables:

| Variable                | Default             | Overridable |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| `NODE_ENV`              | `development`       | yes         |
| `ZERO_LOG_LEVEL`        | from `--log-level`  | yes         |
| `ZERO_NUM_SYNC_WORKERS` | `1`                 | yes         |
| `ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB`      | _(managed by orez)_ | no          |
| `ZERO_CVR_DB`           | _(managed by orez)_ | no          |
| `ZERO_CHANGE_DB`        | _(managed by orez)_ | no          |
| `ZERO_REPLICA_FILE`     | _(managed by orez)_ | no          |
| `ZERO_PORT`             | _(managed by orez)_ | no          |

The `--log-level` flag controls both zero-cache (`ZERO_LOG_LEVEL`) and PGlite's debug output. Default is `warn` to keep output quiet. Set to `info` or `debug` for troubleshooting.

The layering is: orez defaults → your env → orez-managed connection vars. So setting `ZERO_LOG_LEVEL=debug` in your shell overrides the `--log-level` default, but you can't override the database connection strings (orez needs to point zero-cache at its own proxy).

Common vars you might want to set:

```bash
ZERO_MUTATE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/zero/push
ZERO_QUERY_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/zero/pull
```

## What gets faked

The proxy intercepts several things to convince zero-cache it's talking to a real PostgreSQL server with logical replication enabled:

- `IDENTIFY_SYSTEM` returns a fake system ID and timeline
- `CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT` persists slot info in a local table and returns a valid LSN
- `START_REPLICATION` enters streaming mode, encoding changes as pgoutput binary messages
- `version()` returns a standard PostgreSQL 16.4 version string (PGlite's Emscripten string breaks `pg_restore` and other tools)
- `current_setting('wal_level')` always returns `logical`
- `pg_replication_slots` queries are redirected to a local tracking table
- `SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT` is silently accepted (PGlite doesn't support imported snapshots)
- `ALTER ROLE ... REPLICATION` returns success
- `READ ONLY` is stripped from transaction starts (PGlite is single-session)
- `ISOLATION LEVEL` is stripped from all queries (meaningless with a single-session database)
- `SET TRANSACTION` / `SET SESSION` return synthetic success without hitting PGlite

The pgoutput encoder produces spec-compliant binary messages: Begin, Relation, Insert, Update, Delete, Commit, and Keepalive. Column values are encoded as text (typeOid 25) except booleans which use typeOid 16 with `t`/`f` encoding, matching PostgreSQL's native boolean wire format.

## Tests

141 tests — 104 orez tests across 7 test files covering the full stack from binary encoding to TCP-level integration, plus 37 bedrock-sqlite tests covering the WASM SQLite engine:

```
bun run test                                # orez tests
cd sqlite-wasm && bunx vitest run           # bedrock-sqlite tests
```

The orez test suite includes a zero-cache compatibility layer that decodes pgoutput messages into the same typed format that zero-cache's PgoutputParser produces, validating end-to-end compatibility.

The bedrock-sqlite tests cover Database/Statement API, transactions, WAL/WAL2 modes, BEGIN CONCURRENT, FTS5, JSON functions, custom functions, aggregates, bigint handling, and file persistence.

## Limitations

This is a development tool. It is not suitable for production use.

- PGlite is single-session per instance. All queries to the same database are serialized through a mutex. Cross-database queries are independent (each database has its own PGlite instance and mutex). Fine for development but would bottleneck under real load.
- Triggers add overhead to every write. Again, fine for development.
- PGlite stores data on the local filesystem. No replication, no high availability. Use `orez pg_dump` / `orez pg_restore` for backups.

## Backup & Restore

Dump and restore your local PGlite database using WASM-compiled `pg_dump` — no native Postgres install needed.

```
bunx orez pg_dump > backup.sql
bunx orez pg_dump --output backup.sql
bunx orez pg_restore backup.sql
bunx orez pg_restore backup.sql --clean
```

```
pg_dump options:
  --data-dir=.orez    data directory
  -o, --output        output file path (default: stdout)

pg_restore options:
  --data-dir=.orez    data directory
  --clean             drop and recreate public schema before restoring
```

Restore streams the dump file statement-by-statement so it can handle large dumps without loading everything into memory. It also automatically filters out things PGlite can't handle:

- Extensions not available in PGlite (`pg_stat_statements`, `pg_buffercache`, `pg_cron`, etc.)
- `SET transaction_timeout` (PostgreSQL 18+ artifact)
- psql meta-commands like `\restrict`

This means you can take a dump from a production Postgres database and restore it directly into orez — unsupported statements are silently skipped and the rest executes normally.

orez must not be running when using these commands — PGlite data directories are single-process. The commands will detect a locked database and tell you to stop orez first.

Standard Postgres tools (`pg_dump`, `pg_restore`, `psql`) also work against the running proxy since orez presents a standard PostgreSQL 16.4 version string over the wire.

## Extra: orez/s3

Since we use this stack often with a file uploading service like MinIO which also requires docker, I threw in a tiny s3-compatible endpoint too:

`bunx orez --s3` or standalone `bunx orez s3`.

```typescript
import { startS3Local } from 'orez/s3'

const server = await startS3Local({
  port: 9200,
  dataDir: '.orez',
})
```

Handles GET, PUT, DELETE, HEAD with CORS. Files stored on disk. No multipart, no ACLs, no versioning.
